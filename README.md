# Coffee Shop Simulation
Here we will be developing an advanced version and using scrum.
We will be enhancing the Coffee Shop POS developed in Stage 1, to simulate the Coffee Shop operations from Order to Delivery.
Intended functionality will be:
1. POS to take orders
2. Servers to prepare order to deliver
3. Cooks to produce items to deliver
4. Shop Manager to monitor order processing.
